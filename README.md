# Airline-on-time-performance-analysis

1) Background:
Airline on-time performance(OTP) analysis is extremely crucial in the aviation industry. Airline OTP
data assesses the standard of how well aviation services operate based on their delay data. The
amount of delay for each flight contributes directly to productivity and customer satisfaction on the
airline and airports. OTP ranking is an especially powerful marketing tool in an aviation industry with
high liquidity and competitiveness. (Yimga,2021) 

2) Current issue : 
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, there was a huge cut in the aviation industry. Number of flights was
reduced by over 50% (UN News,2021). However, with the world easing travel restrictions and high
vaccination rates, the aviation industry has already been making improvements since the second half
of 2021 and people’s desire for travel has been surging up while the industry is ill-prepared with
reduced number of flights and staff during the pandemic.

3) Scope of analysis :
Considering that the aviation industry is currently recovering from COVID-19 pandemic’s impact,
there was a similar situation of SARS epidemic in 2003. Hence, we will be focusing on the airline OTP
data from 2003 to 2005 where the industry was recovering from the epidemic. Insights obtained
from the data during this period will allow the aviation industry to move forward.

### 5 Question used to analyse airline-on-time performance are: 

1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly
to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations
change over time?
4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays
in others?
5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.
