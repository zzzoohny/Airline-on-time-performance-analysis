# Airline-on-time-performance-analysis

1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly
to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations
change over time?
4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays
in others?
5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays. 

Used 2003-2005 data from Harvard Data Expo 2009: Airline on time data
